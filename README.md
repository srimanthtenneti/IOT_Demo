### 1.RTSP Video Stream
In this project we will use RTSP to stream video over a Wi-Fi interface. The main hardware we would use is going to be a raspberry pi. The only requirement is that the raspi should have a camera and Wi-Fi capability. The image below is a raspberry pi zero configure as a stream device.
